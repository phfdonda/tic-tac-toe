<!-- ABOUT THE GAME -->
## About The Game

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

Game Rules:

1. This is a game for two players.
2. The first player will have the 'X' mark.
3. The second player will have the 'O' mark.
4. The 'table' is composed of 9 numbers ranging from 1 to 9 in a 3X3 grid.
5. The players take turns to choose numbers to mark. Once a number is marked, it is replaced by the player's mark. 
6. The players can choose only one of the numbers of the table that have not been marked yet.
7. The player who marks three numbers in a sequence, be that in a row, column or diagonal, wins.
8. If a turn ends with no available numbers left and no winner, the game ends in a tie.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game, although it may look different than normal. I chose to use numbers and keyboard instead of empty spaces and mouse to make easier for the player to mark the position... and also because that's the limit of my current knowledge - I wouldn't know how to do it differently.

The game can be found following this link: [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/phfdonda/tic-tac-toe)

I tried to make it look as appealing as possible, even though it runs in a terminal.

The goals of this project are:

* Put in practice the theory of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) using Ruby.
* Develop a Ruby project.
* Learn how to separate the classes in files and how to 'require' them.
* Get a real grip on Git Flow and on how to work with it during several parts of a project.

## Installation

Ruby is needed to run this file. Follow these steps to install it: 
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/installing-ruby

You can download the [repo](https://github.com/phfdonda/tic-tac-toe) or clone (paste on the terminal) ```git clone git@github.com:phfdonda/tic-tac-toe.git```

The executable is called 'main' and is located inside a folder called 'bin'. If you are a Linux or Mac user you can follow these [instructions](https://commandercoriander.net/blog/2013/02/16/making-a-ruby-script-executable/) to make the file executable.

Open the terminal and cd to the path where you download the tic-tac-toe game. It should be something like: ```User/<folder>/tic-tac-toe/```. Go to the 'bin' folder, and run the 'main' file.

Enjoy!! 

## Instructions

1. You will use the terminal to play this game.
2. You will be prompted to type the Player 1 name and Player 2 name (press enter after each name)
3. Avoid using the same name for both players, Tic-Tac-Toe won't like. He's picky like that.
4. Also, don't leave the name blank. Tic-Tac-Toe feel hurt if ignored.
5. Don't let Tic-Tac-Toe fool you. It will compliment you, play with you, and then close.
6. If you know the rules, Tic-Tac-Toe won't bother you telling them all over again; you can skip when it asks if you want to skip, by pressing 'y' for 'yes', or 'yes' if are not lazy to type all three letters. Or 'YES', if you feel like yelling at Tic-Tac-Toe. It doesn't mind, it is a gentleman of a game. You can also press 'n' for 'no', or 'no', or if you feel really stressed out, 'NO'. If you try to write anything else, well, Tic-Tac-Toe will get a bit confused. After all it's not that a difficult question, right?
7. If you choose to read the rules, they will be displayed for you, and you can read them as much as you want. Whenever you are ready to begin the game, just press ENTER. Don't try typing anything else. It won't work. I know. I tried.
8. The turns will begin. Each player will choose a number, and the number will be exchanged for their own mark, be that 'X' or 'O'.
9. Do try to make a sequence. It is quite boring when the game ends in a tie.
